# Rainfall Prediction in Australia using XGBoost

## Overview

This project aims to predict rainfall in various regions of Australia based on historical data spanning the past 10 years. Utilizing the XGBoost algorithm, the project was executed under the expert guidance and support of Dr. Aruna Bhatt, Associate Professor at Delhi Technological University.

## Dataset

The dataset encompasses comprehensive rainfall data collected from diverse regions across Australia over a decade. It includes various features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, atmospheric pressure, and more, which are instrumental in predicting the rainfall levels accurately.

## Algorithm

### XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)

XGBoost stands as a powerful and efficient machine learning algorithm renowned for its accuracy and scalability, particularly well-suited for handling extensive datasets. By amalgamating the strengths of gradient boosting and random forest techniques, XGBoost ensures robust and precise predictive modeling capabilities.
